# 👩‍💻 Deploying the workshop

## Building/testing it

`npm start` builds a development version of the Docusaurus workshop. To build the production version locally we should use `npm run build` that also checks links. 

It will create a `build` directory. This is a generated static version of the workshop we can host anywhere. This directory is ignored by git.

The Search Box only works with a production build.

## Github Actions

In `./github/workflows` there's a Github action to automatically deploy this site in Github pages. You just need to push changes to `main` and everything should happen automagically.
